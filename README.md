Information-Theoretic Limits of Time Distinguishability in Diffusion and Anomalous Diffusion
Alexander Yashin
Independent Researcher (Germany)

Motivation

In stochastic systems such as diffusion, time is typically treated as an
external parameter rather than an observable quantity.

This work addresses a precise operational question:

What is the minimal time difference that can be distinguished from data
generated by stochastic dynamics?

The answer is constrained not by metaphysical assumptions or new physics,
but by information-theoretic limits inherent in statistical inference.

Core Idea

Time is treated as an inferred parameter of probability distributions,
not as a primitive variable.

Temporal resolution is fundamentally limited by:

statistical sample size

measurement noise

the underlying dynamical law governing state evolution

This leads to sharp, estimator-independent bounds on temporal
distinguishability.

Main Results

Normal diffusion

For Brownian motion in d dimensions, Fisher information yields a universal
bound of the form:

Delta t_min(t) ~ t * sqrt(2 / (d * N))

where N is the effective number of independent samples.

Hypothesis testing equivalence

The same bound follows from a Kullback-Leibler divergence analysis,
establishing local equivalence between:

estimation-theoretic limits (Cramer-Rao bound)

hypothesis-testing distinguishability

Photon-limited regime

In the experimentally relevant photon-limited setting, a self-consistent
analysis predicts a nontrivial scaling:

Delta t_min proportional to Phi^(-1/3)

where Phi is the photon flux.

This scaling is analytically derived and numerically verified.

Anomalous diffusion

Subdiffusive and superdiffusive dynamics exhibit qualitatively distinct
temporal resolution regimes governed by the anomalous exponent.

All results are:

falsifiable

estimator-independent

require no modification of known physical laws

Reproducibility

All numerical claims are independently verified by Monte Carlo simulations.

To reproduce the key results:

cd src
python simulate_crlb.py
python simulate_photon_limit.py

Expected outcomes:

Empirical variances saturate the Cramer-Rao lower bound

Photon-limited scaling exponent is close to -1/3

Detailed acceptance criteria and reproducibility notes are provided in the
reproducibility directory.
