**Information-Theoretic Limits of Time Distinguishability in Diffusion and Anomalous Diffusion**

## Motivation

In stochastic systems such as diffusion, time is often treated as an
external parameter rather than an observable quantity.

This work asks a precise operational question:

> *What is the minimal time difference that can be distinguished
> from data generated by stochastic dynamics?*

The answer turns out to be constrained not by metaphysics or new physics,
but by **information theory**.

## Core Idea

Time is treated as an *inferred parameter* of probability distributions,
not as a primitive variable.

Temporal resolution is limited by:
- statistical sample size,
- measurement noise,
- the dynamical law governing state evolution.

This leads to sharp, estimator-independent bounds on temporal
distinguishability.

## Main Results

- **Normal diffusion**  
  Fisher information yields a universal bound:
Δt_min(t) ~ t * sqrt(2 / (d N))

- **Hypothesis testing equivalence**  
The same bound follows from Kullback–Leibler divergence, establishing
local equivalence between estimation and testing limits.

- **Photon-limited regime**  
A self-consistent analysis predicts a nontrivial scaling:
Δt_min ∝ Φ^(-1/3)

which is analytically derived and numerically verified.

- **Anomalous diffusion**  
Subdiffusive and superdiffusive dynamics exhibit qualitatively distinct
temporal resolution regimes governed by the anomalous exponent.

All results are falsifiable and require no modification of known
physical laws.

## Reproducibility

All numerical claims are independently verified by Monte Carlo
simulations.

To reproduce the key results:

```bash
cd src
python simulate_crlb.py
python simulate_photon_limit.py
Expected outcomes
Empirical variances saturate the Cramér–Rao lower bound.

Photon-limited scaling exponent is close to −1/3.

Detailed acceptance criteria and reproducibility notes
are provided in the reproducibility/ directory.
