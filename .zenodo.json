  "title": "Information-Theoretic Limits of Time Distinguishability in Diffusion and Anomalous Diffusion",
  "description": "This repository contains analytical and numerical results establishing information-theoretic limits on temporal distinguishability in diffusive and anomalously diffusive systems. Time is treated as an inferred quantity constrained by stochastic dynamics, finite statistics, and measurement noise. The work derives explicit bounds using Fisher information and Kullback–Leibler divergence, identifies a nontrivial photon-limited temporal resolution scaling, extends the framework to anomalous diffusion, and provides falsifiable experimental protocols and reproducible simulations.",
